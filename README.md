# ML-Tkinter
A small program in Python TKinter containing various Machine Learning utilities.

Although functional -this GUI is still a work in progress. It works, but some of the funcationality is still missing.
The basic idea is to create a functionel, streamlined and rudimentary Machine Learning GUI to educate on ML principals 
and make available some of the more basic tools for others who are not familiar with ML and programming.

A lot of inspiration for the being able to change pages in Tkinter came from Sentdex, as it is not a native way of presenting Tkinter applications.
